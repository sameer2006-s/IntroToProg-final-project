## Overview
The LMS is built in C and handles various operations such as adding books, members, tracking borrowed books, and identifying various statistics related to book lending. It stores data for books, members, and their borrowing history.

## Features
- **Book Management**: Add books with specified IDs and copies.
- **Member Management**: Register members with unique IDs.
- **Borrowing System**: Track borrowed books, ensuring there are enough copies available and that members donâ€™t exceed their borrowing limit.
- **Data Retrieval**: Provides various functionalities like listing available books, identifying most borrowed books, and more.
- **Overlapping Borrowers**: Identifies members who borrowed the same book on the same day.

## Usage
The program interacts with the user via standard input. Input is expected in a specific format as described below:

1. **Books Section**: Starts with `Books:` and followed by lines containing book IDs and the number of copies.
2. **Members Section**: Starts with `Members:` followed by member IDs.
3. **Borrowed Books Section**: Contains entries with book IDs, member IDs, and dates.

The program responds to various commands as specified, such as `Number_Books`, `Book_ID_Min`, `Books_Available`, etc.
